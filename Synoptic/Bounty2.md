# Bounty Title: Bot Detection Algorithm Challenge
### Theme: Social Network Analysis
### Prize: 

## Objective 
Participants are tasked with developing an innovative algorithm that can accurately assign a probability of a user being a bot within a social network, leveraging user interactions, post confidence scores, and the dynamic effects of upvotes and downvotes on user weight scores.

### Guidelines and Assumptions:

- **User Weight Score:** Each user is assigned a weight score that starts at a minimum of 1 and has no upper limit. This score represents the user's reputation within the network.
- **Post Confidence Score:** Users specify a confidence score ranging from 50% to 100% for each post, reflecting the author's certainty in the post's content.
- **Voting Impact:** Upvotes and downvotes affect the author's weight score. The impact is calculated as `post_confidence * voter_weight_score * (up ? 1 : -1)`.
- **User Base:** The social network has a substantial user base of at least 100,000, including both genuine and bot accounts, with reputable accounts having higher weight scores.

### Deliverables:

1. **Algorithm Design:**  
   A detailed write-up of the proposed solution, outlining the approach to determining the likelihood of a user being a bot based on the provided metrics and any additional parameters deemed relevant.
2. **Code Implementation:**  
   Working code that demonstrates the algorithm's functionality. The code should be able to process input data reflecting user attributes, post contents, confidence scores, and voting actions to calculate bot probabilities.
3. **Benchmark Development:**  
   Participants must develop a benchmark that simulates real-world social network interactions to test the effectiveness and accuracy of their algorithm.

### Judgment Criteria:

1. **Presentation:**  
    - **Comprehensiveness:** The extent to which the solution addresses potential edge cases and the clarity in explaining the proposed algorithm.
2. **Algorithm Implementation:**  
    - **Accuracy:** The effectiveness of the algorithm in distinguishing between bot and genuine user behavior.
    - **Innovation:** The creativity and uniqueness of the approach in leveraging available data.
3. **Benchmark Implementation:**  
    - **Realism:** The degree to which the benchmark reflects genuine social network dynamics and user interactions.
    - **Effectiveness:** How well the benchmark challenges and evaluates the algorithm's capabilities.
4. **Feasibility:**  
    - **Practicality:** The potential for integrating the algorithm into a live social network as a feature.
    - **Cost Efficiency:** Consideration of the computational resources required and the associated costs.
    - **Data Availability:** The accessibility of necessary inputs for the algorithm to function in a real-world setting.
    - **Licensing:** If external tools or libraries are used, they must be licensed for commercial use.

### Encouraged Strategies:

- Participants are encouraged to explore a wide range of data points, including but not limited to, user engagement patterns, frequency of posts, timing of votes, and the network of interactions between users, to identify bot-like behavior.
- Employing machine learning techniques, network analysis methods, or statistical models to analyze user behavior and voting patterns could provide deeper insights into bot detection.
- Considering the scalability of the solution to handle large volumes of users and posts without compromising on performance or accuracy.


### Conclusion:

This bounty offers a unique challenge to creatively apply data analysis, machine learning, and statistical modeling techniques to tackle the issue of bot detection in social networks. The goal is to develop a robust, efficient, and scalable algorithm that can enhance the integrity of social media platforms by accurately identifying and flagging bot accounts, contributing to a more authentic and trustworthy digital environment.
