# Innovative Use Cases for Account Aggregation on NEAR
### Theme: Open-Ended
### Prize: $1,000

## Objective 
Leverage NEAR's flexible account structures to design and prototype a compelling application that streamlines the user experience through [account aggregation](https://pages.near.org/blog/unlocking-web3-usability-with-account-aggregation/).  
(NEAR's human-readable accounts and flexible key management permissions create a natural foundation for aggregating multiple assets and streamlining interactions across various dApps.)

In particular, emphasize new and innovative ways account aggregation could simplify onboarding, asset management, or interaction with dApps.

### Key Targets for the Hackathon:
1. **Use Case Proposal:**  
   Clearly define a problem that account aggregation solves, outlining the user experience benefits.

2. **Basic UI/UX Flow:**  
   Design a frontend or wireframe illustrating how the solution would enhance the user journey.

3. **Technical Sketch:**  
   Outline the potential smart contract interactions or account structures to realize the proposed solution.

### Data Samples & Sources:
- **NEAR Accounts:**  
  Understand the structure of NEAR accounts via the [explorer](https://nearblocks.io/). Examine fields like transaction history, balances, and associated smart contract permissions.

### Tech Stack Recommendations:
- **Smart Contracts:**  
  Rust or AssemblyScript.

- **Frontend:**  
  JavaScript/TypeScript with a suitable UI framework.

- **Data Storage:**  
  Consider decentralized storage solutions (IPFS, Arweave) if user preferences or usage patterns need to be stored.
