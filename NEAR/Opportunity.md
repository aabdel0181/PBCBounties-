# NEAR Hackathon

NEAR is unlocking the true potential of a multi-chain world. We believe the future lies in seamless experiences, where chain boundaries are abstracted away for users. Shape the future of Web3 with us.

## Post-Hackathon
Winners of this hackathon will be guaranteed an interview for a [HZN](https://www.hzn.xyz/hzn/), NEAR's early-stage accelerator. We work with promising projects through an 8-week program with dedicated technical support, mentorship, business education, and invaluable connections within the NEAR ecosystem.
