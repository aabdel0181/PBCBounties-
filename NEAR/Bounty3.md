# TRACK 3: Decentralized AI on NEAR

## Bounty Title: Decentralized AI Training and Inference on NEAR

**Objective:**  
Develop a protocol or framework facilitating either decentralized AI model training across NEAR's network OR on-chain model inference while maintaining privacy.

**Hackathon Challenge:**  
Prioritize protocol design, proof-of-concept data flows, and addressing the unique challenges of AI workloads on blockchains.

### Example Use Cases:
- **Price Prediction with DEX Data:**  
  Develop a protocol for training a simple price prediction model on DEX trading activity and volumes.

- **NFT Classification:**  
  Design a framework to classify NFTs using their metadata and potentially on-chain interactions.

### Key Targets for the Hackathon:
1. **Protocol Outline & Architecture:**  
   Detail data distribution or parameter sharing (for training) or model input/output mechanisms (for inference).

2. **Privacy Considerations:**  
   Propose methods for preserving the privacy of training data or model parameters if applicable.

3. **Example Use Case Implementation:**  
   Demonstrate a simple AI model or task leveraging the proposed framework, even with simulated data.

### Data Samples & Sources:
- **On-chain Datasets:**  
  Explore public datasets or marketplaces on NEAR (if available). Examples could include DEX activity or NFT metadata.

- **External Data:**  
  If applicable, consider APIs for accessing off-chain datasets or pre-trained AI models.

- **Simulated Data:**  
  For proof-of-concepts, generate synthetic data to represent AI model inputs and outputs.

### Tech Stack Recommendations:
- **Smart Contracts:**  
  Rust or AssemblyScript.

- **AI Libraries:**  
  Research emerging AI libraries or tools compatible with NEAR's environment. This is a less mature space, so creativity is encouraged!
