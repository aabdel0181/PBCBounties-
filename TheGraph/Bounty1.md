## **What is required to complete this prize?**

As a hacker, you can participate in two main categories of bounties offered by The Graph:

- **Best New Subgraph(s):** Build and deploy a custom GraphQL API that indexes data from a smart contract to query blockchain data to your dapp.
    
    All Projects should provide: 
    
    1. Link to the deployed subgraph
    2. Link to the subgraph source code
    3. The project should be using data indexed and queried using the subgraph
    
    Get started [here](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/developing/creating-a-subgraph/)!
    
- **Best Use of Existing Subgraph(s):** Query an existing subgraph on the Graph Explorer or hosted service using the public query URL from the subgraph dashboard.
    
    All Projects should provide: 
    
    1. Link to the code that is consuming a subgraph
    2. The project should be using data from an existing subgraph

**What does success look like? What are possible features that you are looking for?**

We are looking for projects that demonstrate innovative or effective use of The Graph Protocol. This could mean creating a unique subgraph, enabling advanced parameters, implementing advanced querying techniques, or integrating The Graph in a novel way within a decentralized application.

Ideally, the project should be feasible with a clear path to completion and scalability. This means the project can be expanded or adapted for broader or long-term use while also having a design and roadmap that demonstrates decentralization, open access to data, and community empowerment.

The projects potential for future development, investment, and impact on the blockchain ecosystem can be a significant aspect of its success.

**What are the UI/UX Design Requirements**

The primary judging criteria will be on subgraph and substreams design, development and implementation, however a good UI and UX will provide additional success for the project, this is especially true for how the data from The Graph is rendered or presented to its users in the dapp. If you are focused on UI/UX then consider going for the “Best use of an existing subgraph” bounty.

**How are you judging this bounty? What specific criteria do projects needs to be aware of?**

Judges grade all projects on six main criteria described below. All criteria are listed in the order of most weightage to least:

1. **Technical Implementation:** This criteria evaluates the skillful execution of The Graph protocol within the project. Judges will closely examine how effectively the subgraph has been utilized to gather and present data. A project that demonstrates a deep understanding of the protocol's technical intricacies and implements it seamlessly will receive higher scores.
2. **Design:** Quality of the dapp user interface and user experience (UI/UX) of the decentralized application (dapp) are pivotal to its success. Judges will assess the design's aesthetics, intuitiveness, and overall usability. A well-designed dapp not only attracts users but also enhances their interaction with the platform, making it a key factor in the evaluation process.
3. **Quality of Idea:** Quality of the idea/use-case/problem statement. A project that introduces a novel solution or tackles a previously unaddressed problem will be favorably regarded. Judges will consider how innovative and relevant the idea is to the blockchain and decentralized technology landscape.
4. **Impact on Ecosystem:** Impact on society/community/target audience will be assessed here. Judges will weigh the positive changes the project brings to its ecosystem and the potential benefits it offers to its users. Projects that foster community growth, contribute to the advancement of decentralized technologies, or solve real-world problems will excel in this criteria.
5. **Project Sustainability:** The quality of the project's documentation, roadmap, and long-term viability will be analyzed. Judges will scrutinize the clarity and comprehensiveness of the project's documentation, ensuring that it facilitates seamless understanding and collaboration. A well-structured roadmap that outlines future development stages and potential challenges will further enhance a project's appeal.
6. **Vision Alignment:** Holistic approach and vision alignment with the principles of decentralization. Judges will evaluate whether the project's objectives and approach resonate with the ethos of decentralization, blockchain technology, and fostering a more open and inclusive digital ecosystem.

**What is the impact on your organization by a team working on this bounty?**

Good use cases will strengthen the community and creating new interesting subgraphs provide composable data points for the future of web3.
