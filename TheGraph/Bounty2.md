# What does success look like? What are possible features that you are looking for?

We are looking for projects that demonstrate innovative or effective use of The Graph Protocol. This could mean creating a unique subgraph, enabling advanced parameters, implementing advanced querying techniques, or integrating The Graph in a novel way within a decentralized application.

Ideally, the project should be feasible with a clear path to completion and scalability. This means the project can be expanded or adapted for broader or long-term use while also having a design and roadmap that demonstrates decentralization, open access to data, and community empowerment.

The projects potential for future development, investment, and impact on the blockchain ecosystem can be a significant aspect of its success.
