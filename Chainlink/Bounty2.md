# Chainlink Functions Track
### Theme: Infrastructure / AI
### Prize: $1,000

## Objective
Chainlink Functions can help you to build a dApp that pulls (or pushes) data connecting to an external API, this could be a public or private API, a SaaS app, any IoT device, or an enterprise system. In addition to off-chain data, it could utilize off-chain computations on the data as well (for example, aggregate data and put on-chain or connect to decentralized storage systems such as IPFS).

### Possible Use Cases
- Generative AI NFts using Chainlink Functions
- Censorship-resistant news headline aggregator that uses Chainlink Functions and prominent news APIs
- Verifiable AI: Can use Functions to verify the output of an AI LLM, & get an attestation that the output is correct & what the LLM actually outputted
- Add verified web2 credentials to a Lens profile using Chainlink Functions, eg verify Twitter handle with the Lens API & store as a lens custom profile field
- Off-chain storage protocol that uses CL Functions to reach out to off-chain storage services (GCP etc.) to store data or files, then the user must sign a message on-chain to prove ownership to retrieve the file or data

### Requirements
- Each project must use Chainlink Functions in some form to make a state change on a blockchain, otherwise it will not be eligible. This means that a front end simply reading from Chainlink Data Feeds doesn't count. Using Chainlink Functions inside your smart contracts is required.
- While all project submissions are evaluated holistically, there will be bonus points given to projects that use Chainlink Functions together with other Chainlink services in a meaningful way.
- Please let us know how you use Chainlink in the project description.
- It must be possible for the judges to find the Chainlink use in your code. Only the intention to use is not valid.
