# Chainlink CCIP Track

**Total Amount Prize:**  
$1,000

**Best Project using Chainlink CCIP:**  

## Bounty Description
Build something awesome using Chainlink CCIP! The Chainlink Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) provides a single simple interface through which dApps and web3 entrepreneurs can securely meet all their cross-chain needs, including token transfers and arbitrary messaging.

### Possible Use Cases
- Cross-chain DeFi app with liquidity across multiple chains 
- Cross Chain DeFi yield aggregator
- Token bridge powered by CCIP
- Multihop CCIP Router. You want to send cross-chain message from blockchain A to blockchain B without worrying if the lane between them exists

### Requirements
- Each project must use Chainlink CCIP in some form to make a state change on a blockchain, otherwise it will not be eligible. This means that a front end simply reading from Chainlink Data Feeds doesn't count. Using Chainlink CCIP inside your smart contracts is required, though you are encouraged to utilize Chainlink Data Feeds, Chainlink Data Streams, Chainlink VRF, and Chainlink Proof of Reserve as well. 
- While all project submissions are evaluated holistically, there will be bonus points given to projects that use Chainlink CCIP together with other Chainlink services in a meaningful way.
- Please let us know how you use Chainlink in the project description.
- It must be possible for the judges to find the Chainlink use in your code. Only the intention to use is not valid.
