# Bounty 2: Fully Homomorphic Encryption
### Theme: Infrastructure / DeFi
### Prize: $1,000

## Objective  
Participants are tasked with tapping into the potential of fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) by incorporating it into DeFi. FHE opens up the possibility for end-to-end encryption and essentially allows for "confidential and private smart contracts".

### Material
- [Fhenix Documentation](https://www.fhenix.io/)
- [Zama's FHEVM Documentation](https://docs.zama.ai/fhevm/what-is-zamas-fhevm/readme)

**One possible idea to explore includes:**
1. New mechanisms enabled by this:
   - Private constant product AMM where token reserves are not visible
