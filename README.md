### Bounty 1: Best usage of Chainlink CCIP
[Details](<link_to_chainlink_bounty1_details>)  
**Theme:** Open-Ended (choose amongst hackathon themes)  
**Objective:** Build something awesome using Chainlink CCIP! The Chainlink Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) provides a single simple interface through which dApps and web3 entrepreneurs can securely meet all their cross-chain needs, including token transfers and arbitrary messaging.

### Bounty 2: Best usage of Chainlink Functions
[Details](<link_to_chainlink_bounty2_details>)  
**Theme:** Infrastructure / AI  
**Objective:** Chainlink Functions can help you to build a dApp that pulls (or pushes) data connecting to an external API, this could be a public or private API, a SaaS app, any IoT device, or an enterprise system. In addition to off-chain data, it could utilize off-chain computations on the data as well (for example, aggregate data and put on-chain or connect to decentralized storage systems such as IPFS).

### Bounty 3: Best usage of other Chainlink services
[Details](<link_to_chainlink_bounty3_details>)  
**Theme:** Open-Ended (choose amongst hackathon themes)  
**Objective:** Build something awesome using Chainlink! Anything that came from the Chainlink Documentation counts - using Price Feeds, Data Streams, PoR, VRF or Automation

## Range

### Bounty 1: Cross chain connected LPing Strategy using Axelar Intents
[Details](<link_to_range_bounty1_details>)  
**Theme:** Infrastructure / DeFi  
**Objective:** Participants are tasked with developing a connected LPing strategy for ETH USDC pairs across multiple chains: Uniswap v3 on Ethereum, Uniswap v3 on Polygon, and Uniswap v3 on Arbitrum. The rebalancing strategy should be connected across the 3 chains.

### Bounty 2: Fully Homomorphic Encryption
[Details](<link_to_range_bounty2_details>)  
**Theme:** Infrastructure / DeFi  
**Objective:** Participants are tasked with tapping into the potential of fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) by incorporating it into Defi. FHE opens up the possibility for end-to-end encryption and essentially allows for “confidential and private smart contracts”.

### Bounty 3: Systematic NFT Strategies
[Details](<link_to_range_bounty3_details>)  
**Theme:** DeFi
