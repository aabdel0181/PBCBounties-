### Bounty 1: Speed Optimization Challenge for Message-Distribution Systems
[Details](Synoptic/Bounty1.md)  
**Theme:** Infrastructure  
**Objective:** To develop the most efficient message-distribution implementation that ensures minimal latency and variance in message delivery across different scenarios, involving both one-to-many and many-to-many publisher and subscriber connections.

### Bounty 2: Bot Detection Algorithm Challenge
[Details](Synoptic/Bounty2.md)  
**Theme:** Social Network Analysis  
**Objective:** Participants are tasked with developing an innovative algorithm that can accurately assign a probability of a user being a bot within a social network, leveraging user interactions, post confidence scores, and the dynamic effects of upvotes and downvotes on user weight scores.

## Chainlink

### Bounty 1: Best usage of Chainlink CCIP
[Details](Chainlink/Bounty1.md)  
**Theme:** Open-Ended (choose amongst hackathon themes)  
**Objective:** Build something awesome using Chainlink CCIP! The Chainlink Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) provides a single simple interface through which dApps and web3 entrepreneurs can securely meet all their cross-chain needs, including token transfers and arbitrary messaging.

### Bounty 2: Best usage of Chainlink Functions
[Details](Chainlink/Bounty2.md)  
**Theme:** Infrastructure / AI  
**Objective:** Chainlink Functions can help you to build a dApp that pulls (or pushes) data connecting to an external API, this could be a public or private API, a SaaS app, any IoT device, or an enterprise system. In addition to off-chain data, it could utilize off-chain computations on the data as well (for example, aggregate data and put on-chain or connect to decentralized storage systems such as IPFS).

### Bounty 3: Best usage of other Chainlink services
[Details](Chainlink/Bounty3.md)  
**Theme:** Open-Ended (choose amongst hackathon themes)  
**Objective:** Build something awesome using Chainlink! Anything that came from the Chainlink Documentation counts - using Price Feeds, Data Streams, PoR, VRF or Automation

## Range

### Bounty 1: Cross chain connected LPing Strategy using Axelar Intents
[Details](Range/Bounty1.md)  
**Theme:** Infrastructure / DeFi  
**Objective:** Participants are tasked with developing a connected LPing strategy for ETH USDC pairs across multiple chains: Uniswap v3 on Ethereum, Uniswap v3 on Polygon, and Uniswap v3 on Arbitrum. The rebalancing strategy should be connected across the 3 chains.

### Bounty 2: Fully Homomorphic Encryption
[Details](Range/Bounty2.md)  
**Theme:** Infrastructure / DeFi  
**Objective:** Participants are tasked with tapping into the potential of fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) by incorporating it into Defi. FHE opens up the possibility for end-to-end encryption and essentially allows for “confidential and private smart contracts”.

### Bounty 3: Systematic NFT Strategies
[Details](Range/Bounty3.md)  
**Theme:** DeFi  
**Objective:** Participants are tasked to come up with innovative strategies on top of existing NFT marketplaces—focusing on liquidity vaults for ERC404s.

## The Graph

### Bounty 1: Best New Subgraph
[Details](TheGraph/Bounty1.md)  
**Theme:** Open-Ended (choose amongst hackathon themes)  
**Objective:** Build and deploy a custom subgraph that indexes data from a smart contract to query blockchain data for your dapp.

### Bounty 2: Best Use of Existing Subgraph
[Details](TheGraph/Bounty2.md)  
**Theme:** Open-Ended (choose amongst hackathon themes)  
**Objective:** Query a new or existing subgraph on the Graph Explorer or hosted service using the public query URL from the subgraph dashboard.

## NEAR Protocol

### Bounty 1: Cross-Chain Convergence and Interoperability
[Details](NEAR/Bounty1.md)  
**Theme:** Infrastructure  
**Objective:** Design a proof-of-concept demonstrating the core mechanisms for initiating a stablecoin swap (e.g., USDC) between the NEAR and Ethereum blockchains.

### Bounty 2: Account Aggregation for Enhanced User Experience
[Details](NEAR/Bounty2.md)  
**Theme:** Open-Ended (choose amongst hackathon themes)  
**Objective:** Leverage NEAR's flexible account structures to design and prototype a compelling application that streamlines the user experience through account aggregation.

### Bounty 3: Decentralized AI on NEAR
[Details](NEAR/Bounty3.md)  
**Theme:** AI / ML  
**Objective:** Develop a protocol or framework facilitating either decentralized AI model training across NEAR's network OR on-chain model inference while maintaining privacy.

## Aptos
